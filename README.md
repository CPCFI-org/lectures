Â¡Welcome to CPCFI ðŸ‘‹! ~ UNAM's School of Engineering Competitive Programming Club

We're a bunch of nerds that:

- Spend most of their time solving unsolvable problems :sunglasses:
- Thinking about big numbers :smirk:
- Cursing online judges that throw ```WA```, ```TLE``` or any other verdict that is not <span style="color:green">Accepted</span> :rage:

**No, really, what do we do?**

- Study algorithms and data structures (even a ```double ended queue```) to solve computer programming problems as fast as possible. How fast?
  - Well, about 12-13 problems in 5 hours
  - Check out [this problemset](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/71296) if you want get an idea
- Solve, solve and solve competitive programming problems
- Wondering why [UVa](https://onlinejudge.org/) shuts down between 20:00-22:00 and thinking of maybe coming back to [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/)
- ... solve more problems ...
- And, compete at [ACM ICPC](https://icpc.global/), the equivalent of the Super Bowl or FIFA World Cup of competitive programming

## Contact

Feel free to reach out to us if you have any questions, we'll be glad to answer.
Specifically if you have any of the following questions:
    
- Why can't I use brute force for any problem? :weary:
- VSCode, Sublime or vim? :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:
- But please, don't email us if you need help with your homework. Nah, we're just kidding, we could solve your CS homework quite fast if you are willing to spend some BTC :money_with_wings:
- Or, who is John Galt? :flushed:
